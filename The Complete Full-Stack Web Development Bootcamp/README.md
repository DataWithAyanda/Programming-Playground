# The Complete Web Development Bootcamp
### By Ayanda Mtati

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository documents my progression through *The Complete Web Development Bootcamp* on Udemy, instructed by Dr. Angela Yu. 

Rather than a transition into full-stack development, this repository represents a **technical expansion** of my core expertise. I am building a web development layer over my foundation in **Industrial & Organisational Psychology** and **Data Analytics** to create more robust, end-to-end solutions.

Each folder represents a specific module or a major capstone project from the course.

## 🎯 Purpose

My focus remains at the intersection of **Human Behaviour, Data, and Technology**. I am mastering web technologies to:

- **Deploy Scalable Tools:** Moving from local Python scripts to web-accessible tools for organizational interventions.
- **Enhanced Data Visualization:** Building interactive, browser-based dashboards that make complex behavioral data digestible for stakeholders.
- **Productive Prototyping:** Rapidly developing internal interfaces for psychological assessments and HR workflow automation.
- **Technical Literacy:** Strengthening my ability to collaborate with engineering teams by understanding the full modern web stack.

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy
Utility over Ubiquity. I focus on the parts of the web stack that add the most value to data delivery and human-centric design. Understanding the "how" to better execute the "why."
