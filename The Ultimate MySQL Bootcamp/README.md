# The Ultimate MySQL Bootcamp
### By Ayanda Mtati

## 📌 Overview

This repository documents my progression through *The Ultimate MySQL Bootcamp* on Udemy, instructed by Colt Steele. 

This is a deep dive into relational database management. It represents the "data persistence" layer of my technical toolkit, moving beyond static CSV files to structured, scalable, and queryable data systems.

Each folder represents a specific database schema, complex query exercise, or a major data modeling project.

## 🎯 Purpose

In the context of **Industrial & Organisational Psychology** and **Data Analytics**, mastering SQL is critical for:

- **Managing Large-Scale People Data:** Handling complex organizational hierarchies and employee lifecycle data.
- **Advanced Data Auditing:** Writing sophisticated queries to extract insights from raw HRIS (Human Resources Information Systems) data.
- **Backend Integration:** Connecting my Python automation scripts and Web applications to a reliable "source of truth."
- **Data Integrity:** Ensuring that behavioral and performance data is stored with precision and relational logic.

## 🗂 Repository Structure

The database projects are organized as follows:

Project-Name/
│
├── schema.sql       # Tables, Constraints, and Relationships
├── queries.sql      # Complex JOINs, Aggregations, and Analytics
├── data/            # Mock datasets / CSV seeds
└── README.md        # Logic breakdown and EER Diagrams

Every project includes:
 * Relational Mapping: Explanation of One-to-Many and Many-to-Many relationships.
 * Practical Use-Case: (e.g., "Analyzing Employee Turnover Rates" or "Tracking Training Completion").

🚀 How to Run a Project
Ensure you have MySQL installed and running:
 * Clone the repository:
<!-- end list -->
git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mysql-bootcamp.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mysql-bootcamp.git)

 * Source the schema in your MySQL shell:
<!-- end list -->
source path/to/schema.sql;

 * Run the analysis queries:
<!-- end list -->
source path/to/queries.sql;

## 💼 Career Alignment
This database expertise is the backbone of my work in:
 * I/O Psychology: Building relational models for 360-degree feedback and organizational climate surveys.
 * Business Intelligence: Preparing structured data for visualization in tools like Tableau, PowerBI, or custom web dashboards.
 * System Architecture: Understanding how data flows from a user interaction (Web) to a permanent record (SQL).

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy
Structure defines Insight. I focus on designing schemas that reflect real-world human behavior and organizational logic. A well-structured database is the difference between "data noise" and "actionable intelligence."
